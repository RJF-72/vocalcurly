4. Ownership and Reservation of Rights
The Software is licensed, not sold. The Authors retain all right, title, and interest in and to the Software and all intellectual property rights therein. No rights are granted except as expressly provided in this Agreement.

5. Confidentiality
The Software (including design details and performance characteristics) constitutes confidential information of the Authors. You shall maintain its confidentiality and use at least the same degree of care You use to protect Your own confidential information, but not less than reasonable care.

6. Feedback
Any feedback, suggestions, or improvements You provide may be used by the Authors without restriction. You hereby assign to the Authors all right, title, and interest in such feedback.

7. Third-Party Components
The Software may depend on third-party components (e.g., JUCE, LibTorch/PyTorch, ONNX Runtime). Those components are licensed separately and subject to their respective licenses. You are solely responsible for obtaining and complying with any third-party licenses. Use of JUCE under GPL requires compliant distribution; proprietary distribution of JUCE-based builds requires a valid commercial JUCE license.

15. Assignment
You may not assign or transfer this Agreement or any rights hereunder without prior written consent from the Authors. Any attempted assignment without consent is void.

16. Entire Agreement; Severability; Waiver
